<h1 id="1-introduction">1 Introduction</h1>
<p>An Operating System is a program that manages the computer hardware.</p>
<p>It also provides a basis for application programs and acts as an intermediary between computer users and computer hardware.</p>
<p>e.g., Windows, Linux, Android, iOS…</p>
<h1 id="2-basics-of-os">2 Basics of OS</h1>
<h2 id="21-computer-system-operation">2.1 Computer System Operation</h2>
<p>A modern general-purpose computer system consists of</p>
<ul>
<li>one or more CPUs,</li>
<li>a number of device controllers connected through a common bus that provides access to shared memory</li>
</ul>
<p>Each device controller is in charge of a specific type of device</p>
<p>The CPU and the device controllers can execute concurrently, competing for memory cycles</p>
<p>To ensure orderly access to the shared memory, a memory controller is provided whose function is to synchronize access to the memory</p>
<ul>
<li>Some important terms:
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Bootstrap Program</strong></p>
<p>The initial program that runs when a computer is powered up or rebooted</p>
<p>It is stored in the ROM</p>
<p>It must know how to load the OS and start executing that system</p>
<p>It must locate and load into memory the OS kernel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interrupt</strong></p>
<p>The occurrence of an event is usually signaled by an Interrupt from Hardware or Software</p>
<p>Hardware may trigger an interrupt at any time by sending a signal to the CPU, usually by the way of the system bus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>System Call (Monitor Call)</p>
<p>Software may trigger an interrupt by executing a special operation called System Call</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When the CPU is interrupted, it stops what it is doing and immediately transfers execution to a fixed location. (The fixed location usually contains the starting address where the Service Routine of the interrupt is located)</p>
<p>The Interrupt Service Routine executes.</p>
<p>On completion, the CPU resumes the interrupted computation</p>
<h2 id="22-storage-structure">2.2 Storage Structure</h2>
<h2 id="23-io-structure">2.3 I/O Structure</h2>
<p>A large portion of operating system code is dedicated to managing I/O, both because of its importance to the reliability and performance of a system and because of the varying nature of the devices.</p>
<p>A general-purpose computer system consists of CPUs and multiple device controllers that are connected through a common bus</p>
<p>Each device controller is in charge of a specific type of device</p>
<p>A device maintains Local Buffer Storage and  a set of Special Purpose Registers</p>
<p>Typically, operating systems have a device driver for each device controller</p>
<p>This device driver understands the device controller and presents a uniform interface to the device to the rest of the operating system</p>
<h1 id="3-computer-system-architecture">3 Computer System Architecture</h1>
<ul>
<li>Types of Computer Systems based on the number of General Purpose Processors:
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>1. Single Processor System</strong></p>
<p>One main CPU is capable of executing a general purpose instruction set including instructions from user processes</p>
<p>Other special purpose processors are also present which perform device-specific tasks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2. Multiprocessor System</strong></p>
<p>Also known as parallel systems or tightly coupled systems.</p>
<p>Has two or more processors in close communication, sharing the computer bus and sometimes the clock, memory, and peripheral devices</p>
<p>Advantages:<br>
Increased throughput<br>
Economy of scale<br>
Increased reliability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>3. Clustered System</strong></p>
<p>Like multiprocessor systems, clustered systems gather together multiple CPUs to accomplish computational work</p>
<p>They are composed of two or more individual systems coupled together</p>
<p>Provides high availability</p>
<p>Can be structured asymmetrically (one machine in Host-Standby mode, others run applications),<br>
or symmetrically (two or more hosts run applications, and monitor each other)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="4-operating-system-structure">4 Operating System Structure</h1>
<ul>
<li>Commonality
<ul>
<li>
<p>Multiprogramming</p>
<p>A single user cannot, in general, keep either the CPU or the I/O devices busy at all time</p>
<p>Multiprogramming increases CPU utilization by organizing jobs (code and data) so that the CPU always has one to execute.</p>
<p>Multiprogrammed systems provide an environment in which the various system resources are utilized effectively, but they do not provide for user interaction with the computer system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Time Sharing (Multitasking)</p>
<p>CPU executes multiple jobs by switching among them</p>
<p>Switches occur so frequently that the users can interact with each program while it is running</p>
<p>Time-sharing requires an interactive (or hands-on) computer system, which provides direct communication between the user and the system.</p>
<p>A time-shared operating system allows many users to share the computer simultaneously.</p>
<p>Uses CPU scheduling and multiprogramming to provide each user with a small portion of a time-shared computer.</p>
<p>Each user has at least one separate program in memory</p>
<p>A program loaded into memory and executing is called a “PROCESS”</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="5-operating-system-services">5 Operating System Services</h1>
<p>An OS provides an environment for the execution of programs</p>
<p>It provides certain services to programs and to users of those programs.</p>
<ol>
<li>User Interface (Command line Interface, or Graphic User Interface)</li>
<li>Program Execution</li>
<li>I/O Operations</li>
<li>File System Manipulation</li>
<li>Communications</li>
<li>Error Detection</li>
<li>Resource Allocation</li>
<li>Accounting</li>
<li>Protection and Security</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="6-user-operating-system-interface">6 User Operating System Interface</h1>
<p>CLI allows users to directly enter commands that are to be performed by the operating system</p>
<p>GUI allows users to interface with the operating system in a graphic way</p>
<p>Some operating systems include the command interpreter in the kernel.</p>
<p>Others, such as Windows XP and UNIX, treat the command interpreter as a special program.</p>
<p>On systems with multiple command interpreters to choose from, the interpreters are known as shells. (e.g., Bourne shell, C shell, Bourne-Again Shell, Korn shell, etc.)</p>
